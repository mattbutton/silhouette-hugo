## About the theme

Hi I'm [Matt Button](https://www.mattbutton.com), the creator of the Hugo Silhoutte theme.

I've been a fan of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for many years.

Back in 2016, inspired by the theme on [Troy Hunt's blog](https://www.troyhunt.com/), I hacked together a custom Hugo theme for [my personal blog](https://www.mattbutton.com) using Bootstrap 3.

In 2018 I rebuilt the theme using [Bootstrap 4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/), and decided to share it with the Hugo community under the name "Silhouette Hugo".

## Usage

Create a new Hugo site by typing

```
  $ hugo new site <SITENAME>
```

Then clone this repository:

```
  $ cd <SITENAME>/themes
  $ git clone https://github.com/mattbutton/silhouette-hugo.git
```

Add the theme to your site's config file:

```
  $ cd ..
  $ echo 'theme = "silhouette-hugo"' >> config.toml
```

Now take a look at the exampleSite folder and you're ready to go!
